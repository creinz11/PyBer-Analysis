# PyBer-Analysis

## Overview

During this challenge, we were tasked with creating a summary data frame for PyBer, a ride sharing company. The data provided for our analysis was high-level information regarding trips, fares, drivers, and city types. For this particular analysis, we were asked to calculate Total Rides, Total Fares, Average fare per Rider, and average fare per Driver by city type. PyBer classifies City Types as Urban, Suburban and Rural.

## Results

The below chart captures the summation of the new data frame by City Type. As expected, The majority of the drivers, and revenue are attributable to the Urban type, followed by Suburban and Rural. While the Urban type will always be the "bread and butter" of ride sharing firms, it is important to note the profitability of of rural type. The Rural type accounted for the hghest average fare by driver and by ride. We can infer that this is due to the longer trip durations vs. the Urban and Suburban type. Operations in Rural areas may prove to be a worth-while venture to support profitability.

In addition to the pricing and operation data in the above chart, we also identify some interesting findings in the below graph. The graph captures total ares by city type for January to April. During this time period, we saw spikes in fare revenue across all city types towards the end of February. While more data is needed to support this claim, the end of February is President' Week in the United States, and is a popular time to travel. This may be a possible reason for revenue growth during this time. Another additional finding is the growth of Suburban fares beginning in April. Should this trend continue, PyBer may need to consider ramping up operations or allocating more drivers to the suburbs.

## Summary

Based on the analysis conducted, there are a few ways PyBer may be able to improve operations and revenue growth. There is a clear disparity in the number of drivers accross city types. PyBer should evaluate driver incentives in underserved markets. This would provide two strategic benefits; wider accessibility of the PyBer Service, and stabilize fares. PyBer should build on this anaysis to identify a target average fare by demo, which should help manage supply and demand. In addition to stimulating driver demand and targeting average fares, PyBer should offer clients iding incentives during slow periods. Using app data, PyBer can send inactive clients stimulation messages with a discount code to normalize demand year round.
